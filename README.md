## » Requirements

- Spigot or Paper `1.21.11+`
- Java 25
- Optional: [PacketEvents](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) for match player tab-list hiding
- Optional: [PlaceholderAPI](https://placeholderapi.com) for placeholders

## » Tab List Hiding

When `hide.match-players-in-tab` is enabled and PacketEvents is installed, players outside a match cannot see its participants in the tab list.

Each match only displays its own participants, while lobby players remain separate from active matches.

Match visibility also scopes chat, death, and advancement messages between concurrent matches.

> **Note:** Advancement message isolation requires Paper and is unavailable on Spigot.

## » Building

Requires Java 25 and Maven.

```sh
mvn clean package
